# GNU autotools commit 6a675ef17edf7109da189f5ae70e2dc6b7665896 incorrectly
# assumes make is always named "make" rather than respecting $MAKE.
#
# https://people.freebsd.org/~bdrewery/patches/autotools-MAKE.diff has an
# example fix.
#
# repro: ./configure --enable-maintainer-mode && touch Makefile.in && gmake
#
# For now just redirect to gmake when needed.

#exec 2>${MAKE_TERMERR:-/dev/stderr}
#set -x

if [ -n "${MAKE}" ]; then
	exec command -p ${MAKE} "$@"

# gmake doesn't use - for first char
